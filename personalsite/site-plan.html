      <h3>The Vision</h3>
      <p>
        The basic purpose of the site should serve as a resume. The advantage of building the site myself will be twofold: I will both (1) be able to moderate and build the page to look and feel however I want, and (2) be able to use the site itself as part of my portfolio. Making it a publicly accessible project on GitHub will ensure that anyone viewing the page will be able to have easy access to its source code.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Visit the Site?</h3>
      <p>
        Those visiting the site would be able to see information on me and some of the projects that I’ve worked on. I hope to include a blog-style page that I will update regularly to include some of my recent projects. Hopefully, visitors to the page will be able to find information on any accomplishments that I have, anything I am working on, and information on how to contact me.
      </p>

      <h3>The Landing (Home) Page</h3>
      <p>
        The main page will contain basic information about me: my name, some background information about me, my contact information, etc. There should be at least one photo of me as well. This should be very “business” oriented, and should be similar to what might be expected from a typical resume. It should include links to my LinkedIn and GitHub pages.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img src="images/logo.png" alt="image of my logo">
        <img src="images/me.jpg" alt="image of me">

      <h3>About Me Page</h3>
      <p>
        There will be an “About Me” page, which will go more in depth about me and who I am as a person. It will include my family, hobbies, interests, and that sort of thing. This will serve the purpose of letting any potential employers understand better who I am and what to expect from hiring me, so this page should supply ample information geared towards that.
      </p>

        <img src="images/playin-bass.jpg" alt="image of me playing the bass">

      <h3>"Blog" Style Page</h3>
      <p>
        Admittedly, this is the page that I think I’m the most excited for. I am a rather curious and self-motivated person, which leads me often down paths where I have personal projects (that I refer to as “Passion Projects”) that are typically something that stretches me and what I believe to be my capabilities. This will be the part of the site where I can “report” the progress of these projects. Eventually, this might be some kind of a “hub” that provides links to each individual project, each having their own individual blogs, but for now, keeping the scope reasonable and applicable for class, will be in a more traditional journal style. The most projects should be towards the top of the page, with older projects falling towards the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section will serve well to show off what I’m capable of and the skills that I have learned over the years. The benefit of it for me is that I can work on things that I enjoy, and people can see the attention I’ve put into it!

      <h3>Headers and Footers</h3>
      <p>
        The headers and footers should be clear and concise and should follow the same stylistic choices through all the pages. It should always be clear where someone is within the site, and how to navigate around. The nav bar should include navigation to the various other pages and the footer should include my contact information, so it can be readily available to any visitor.
      </p>

      <h3>Do it all in style!</h3>
      <p>
        Stylistically, the page should always remain professional, but also include my personality as well. Whether it be color choice, font choice, wording, or whatever it may be, the user should have a sense as to who I am as a person. Fonts should be professional and easy to read, and should serve the purpose of the page. Because mint green is my favorite color, I want to include it in the design of the page (the site is supposed to represent me, after all!).

        Wireframes

        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>
