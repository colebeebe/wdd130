      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <h4>I'm an aspiring Software Engineer based in Atlanta, Georgia</h4>
      <p>
        Originally from Rigby, Idaho, I began my studies in Software Engineering a mere 20 minute drive from home at Brigham Young University - Idaho. There, I met my beautiful wife, and we are expecting a little baby girl at the end of the year. We recently moved to Atlanta, Georgia and have been loving every moment of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        More than anything, I love technology and how it has developed over the years. Everything from the evolution of video game consoles or how the standard for computer input became the keyboard and mouse fascinates me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy a variety of different video games but prefer any of the souls games developed by FromSoftware, and have beaten most of them. My favorite console was the Nintendo 64, as it was what my friends and I spent hours playing when I was a kid.

      <h4>Ashida Wii Portable</h4>
      <p>
        This is one of my crowning achievements. This is a full Nintendo Wii console portabalized into a handheld-style console. Boasting roughly two hours of battery life and the full capability of the Nintendo Wii console, it is hard to believe that this device is even real. I have access to all of my Wii and GameCube games at any time, anywhere I go. Or, if I really wanted to, I could connect Wii Remotes via bluetooth and play Mario Kart Wii with friends. Additionally, a "tethered" mode is also supported, allowing you to play your games on a television.

        Just like many young boys from my generation, it was a common dream of mine that Jedi Knight would find me and tell me that I was the chosen one and take me off to study the Jedi ways. While that never came true, I was able to design and build my own lightsaber. This creation uses a Crystal Focus CFX Soundboard at its core and has a brilliantly bright Neopixel blade, which I also was able to construct. I designed the 3D-printed housing that holds all of the wiring as well. From start to finish, I designed every part of this project, and am very proud of the result.
