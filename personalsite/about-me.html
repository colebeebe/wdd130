                <p id="am_p1">
                    Originally from Rigby, Idaho, I began my studies in Software Engineering a mere 20 minute drive from home at Brigham Young University - Idaho. There, I met my beautiful wife, and we are expecting our first - a little baby girl around the end of the year. We recently moved to Atlanta, Georgia and have been loving every moment of it.

                    More than anything, I love technology and how it has developed over the years. Everything, from the evolution of video game consoles to how the standard for computer input has become the keyboard and mouse, fascinates me.

                    I also like watching movies, and have a growing personal collection of over five hundred titles. My movie tastes range anywhere from animated to horror to rom-com to action to sci-fi and pretty much everything in between. I'm always up for a good movie recommendation, although at times I'm told I'm a little <em>too</em> critical of movies.

                    I enjoy a variety of different video games but prefer any of the Souls games developed by FromSoftware, and have beaten most of them. My favorite console was (and continues to be) the Nintendo 64, as it was what my friends and I spent hours playing when I was a kid.

                    I've played piano since I was about 7 but later in life found that my passion for music truly lies in vocal performance. I like singing along with anything but prefer singing opera music. One of my favorite artists is Andrea Bocelli.

                    Before we moved, I played bass guitar in a small local band in Rexburg, Idaho called The White Pines, and it is one of many things that I miss about living in Idaho.
