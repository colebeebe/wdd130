    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        The purpose of developing the website will be to allow potential customers
        a place to find more information about the company; the site should simultaneously
        address any questions the customer may have as well as making the customer feel
        safe in our hands, given the nature of the activity. The site should also include
        proper methods of communication so that they may get in touch should it be apporpriate.
        It should also look professional (and not an eyesore) to further increase the potential
        customer's trust in the business and so as to not drive them from the page (often
        times, a frustrating or unsightly webpage will cause users to want to leave the
        page rather than stay).
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
        Typically, the demographic that would be interested in the product would be young
        adults (being roughly 20-35 years of age) and families with children above the age
        of about 8. Naturally, white water rafting tends to attract people that may be seeking
        some form of thrill, hence the appeal to young adults. For these customers a more intense
        section of the river should be chosen. Often times, families may want an experience
        that builds stronger bonds. If the family comprises of younger children or the members
        are generally inexperienced, a simpler section should be chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
        The audience should be expected to typically access the site via desktop or laptop
        computers, but should be mobile-friendly in the event that it is accessed in
        that way.

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
