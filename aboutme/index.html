        <h2>Cole Beebe-Urbanawiz</h2>
        <p>I'm from Rigby, Idaho. I am currently studying Software Engineering.</p>
        <p>I like to do anything related to technology; I run game servers, I host a Plex media server (If you don't know what that is, look it up. You won't regret it), I build portable Wii's, things like that. I love all of the FromSoft games. I also enjoy movies, a good book, 80's music, good food, and I love space and aviation.</p>
        <p>I'm currently looking for a job; my wife and I recently moved to Atlanta, Georgia. We're anxiously awaiting our baby, who will be born at the end of the year.</p>
